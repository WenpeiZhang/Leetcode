I personally just came up with a solution using brute force Algorithm. 
Apparently it didn't work well. First of all, its runtime is O(n^2), 
and secondly there had been a runtime error when running the program. 
I looked it up a bit and it probably occurred when freeing the pointer. Oddly it runs fine in Xcode though.
